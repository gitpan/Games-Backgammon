Games/Backgammon version 0.13
=============================

This module helps to analyze and modelling backgammon games. 
Most routines are simple wrappers around the open source project gnubg
of Gary Wong.

Note that it is not finished yet and I'm currently working on the module.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

You will need the Inline module and a C compiler as there are many routines
written in C.
