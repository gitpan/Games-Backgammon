Games/Backgammon version 0.07
=============================

This module helps to analyze and modelling backgammon games. 
Most routines are simple wrappers around the open source project gnubg
of Gary Wong.

Note that it is not finished yet and I'm currently working on the module.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

You will need the Inline module and a C compiler as there are many routines
written in C.

As this module is (or has to become) a wrapper around gnubg,
first gnubg is compiled. That will happen when you call
perl Makefile.PL

NOTE

gnubg is itself some mega bytes big.
As I have also bundled a weight file (that would be necessary so or so),
this module will need some time to download!

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

   Inline            0.44,
   List::Util        1.07,
   Carp              
   Data::Dumper      
   Archive::Tar   

For testing also

   Test::More        
   Test::Differences 
   Test::Exception   
   
CHANGES ON gnubg

gnubg 0.13.0 is bundled with this package.
The source is original,
I only added to "Makefile.am",
some lines that also a static library "libgnubg.a"
is compiled, too.

I'm sorry that it is also necessary to download all gnubg stuff,
also if you have already installed.
It would be necessary that gnubg installes itselfs a shared library.
But I think, we'll have to wait at least to gnubg 0.14 for it.
